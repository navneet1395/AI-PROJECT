**Using an Algorithm Portfolio to Solve Sokoban**

Abstractâ€” As the world is giving a new birth daily to the technology and advancing it. The biggest role in advancing the technology is the artificial intelligence which is a science that makes computer think like people, act like people, think rationally and act rationally. As in every process we have a state where we need a machine to act like human and find out the solutions to come out of the state with his own rational power. Here in this paper we have taken the state of a game which is Sokoban which is a very interesting game where we have applied the algorithm.

description
For solving the sokoban puzzle we created a algorithm port-folio so that we can fnd the optimal algorithm for the given state Breath First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS),Greedy Search and A* search algorithm. To find the optimal algorithm we compare the no. of steps taken for competion and the time for the analy-sis.
